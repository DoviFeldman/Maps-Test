Grok 4 had no instruction, just comments in the code, interesting.


This single HTML file creates a simple routing application that:

Works immediately - Just save it as index.html and upload to GitHub Pages
Uses OpenStreetMap data - No need to upload OSM files; it uses online OSM tiles and routing
Simple interface - Click once for start point (green marker), click again for end point (red marker)
Automatic routing - Routes appear automatically after setting both points
City search - Change the city by typing a name and clicking "Change City"
Clear function - Reset everything with the "Clear Route" button
To use on GitHub Pages:

Create a new GitHub repository
Save this code as index.html
Upload it to your repository
Go to Settings → Pages → Enable GitHub Pages from main branch
Your app will be live at https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/
Important notes:

This uses online routing (OSRM servers), not offline OSM files, because true offline routing in a browser is complex and requires large preprocessing
The routing is free and uses OpenStreetMap data
It works on any device with internet
The map starts centered on Deal, NJ but you can change to any city
The app is intentionally kept simple - just click twice to get a route. The routing uses real road networks and provides turn-by-turn directions in the panel that appears.
